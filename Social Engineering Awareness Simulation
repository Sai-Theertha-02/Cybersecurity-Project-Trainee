Overview
This project demonstrates an ethical phishing awareness simulation using GoPhish on Kali Linux.
The objective is not to attack, but to educate users on how phishing emails work and how to identify them. The simulation was conducted in a controlled lab environment using test email accounts only.

Objective
⦁	To demonstrate how phishing emails trick users using social engineering techniques
⦁	To train users to identify phishing red flags
⦁	To measure user interaction safely (opens & clicks)
⦁	To design an internal security awareness campaign
⦁	To promote cyber hygiene best practices

Tool Used
1.	GoPhish Framework
2.	Platform: Kali Linux
3.	Type: Open-source phishing simulation tool
4.	Purpose:
   Create phishing email templates
   Simulate email delivery
   Track user awareness metrics
   Redirect users to an awareness page instead of harvesting data

Why GoPhish?
Industry-standard tool
Used by blue teams and SOC analysts
Supports ethical training campaigns

1.	Phishing Email Template:

Subject: Immediate Action Required – Email Security Alert

Dear User,
We detected unusual login activity on your email account.
To prevent temporary suspension, please review your security
settings immediately.
[ Review Activity ]

IT Security Team
Company Name

Social Engineering Techniques Used:
⦁	Urgency (“Immediate Action Required”)
⦁	Fear (Account suspension warning)
⦁	Authority (IT Security Team)
⦁	Generic greeting
⦁	Call-to-action button

**No malicious links or credential harvesting were used.**

2. Landing Page:

Instead of a fake login page, users were redirected to an education page.

Awareness Message Displayed:
This was a PHISHING SIMULATION.

Red Flags:
✔ Urgent language
✔ Generic greeting
✔ Suspicious link
✔ Pressure tactics

Always verify emails before clicking.
Report suspicious emails to IT Security.

Lessons Learned:
⦁	Phishing emails rely more on psychology than technology
⦁	Urgency and authority significantly increase click rates
⦁	Generic greetings are a major red flag
⦁	Many users click links without checking URLs
⦁	Awareness training reduces repeated mistakes

Preventive Recommendations
To reduce phishing risks:
     Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
     Conduct regular phishing awareness training
Teach users to:
     Hover over links
     Verify sender domains
     Avoid urgency-based emails
     Use email security gateways
     Encourage immediate reporting of suspicious emails

Ethical Considerations:
No real users were targeted
No passwords or sensitive data were collected
All activities were performed in a controlled lab environment
Purpose was education only

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how phishing attacks operate and how awareness training can significantly reduce human-related security risks. It highlights the importance of user education as a critical layer of cybersecurity defense.
