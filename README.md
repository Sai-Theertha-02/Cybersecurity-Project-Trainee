🛡️ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Projects


📌 Overview
This repository is dedicated to Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking, focusing on practical, hands-on implementations of security concepts used in real-world environments. The goal of this project is to help learners, researchers, and security professionals understand how attacks work, how to detect them, and how to defend systems effectively.

All projects in this repository are built with a defensive-first and ethical mindset, following responsible security practices.

🎯 Objectives
⦁	Understand real-world cyber threats and attack techniques
⦁	Implement detection and monitoring mechanisms
⦁	Learn system hardening and incident response
⦁	Practice ethical hacking in controlled environments
⦁	Bridge the gap between theory and real-world security operations
